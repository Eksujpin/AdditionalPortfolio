# What's in here
Welcome to this repository! Here, you will find samples of older Unity projects that I worked on during my high school years. These projects were typically developed in groups, and while my main role was in the programming team, I also contributed to various aspects such as level design, audio design, and 3D modeling to some extent.

Please note that these projects are from my earlier days, so they may not reflect my current skill level or the technologies I am currently working with. However, they still serve as a valuable showcase of my experience and growth as a developer. Feel free to explore and get a glimpse into my journey in game development and Unity programming.
