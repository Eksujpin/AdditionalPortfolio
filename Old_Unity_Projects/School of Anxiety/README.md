#What's this
Welcome to our exam project in the Game Design subject during my high school years. This project holds a special place as it was our most ambitious and well-received endeavor. Our primary goal was to create a game that would generate awareness about life with anxiety.

Within this project, I took on the role of a secondary programmer and a level designer. As a programmer, I worked closely with the team to implement crucial features and ensure smooth gameplay mechanics. Additionally, as a level designer, I had the exciting opportunity to craft immersive worlds within the Unity game engine.

We dedicated ourselves to developing an engaging and thought-provoking experience that sheds light on the challenges faced by individuals living with anxiety, and showcased how their dayily life could be visuallized
