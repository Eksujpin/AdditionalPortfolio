Welcome to the Statwars project! Statwars is a mobile game that was developed as a short project. The game is designed for two players and is played on a single device. Each player builds a character card and then battles against each other.

During the development of this project, my primary focus was on gameplay and animation programming, as well as testing.

Requirments:
- Android device preferably a phone.
- Android version 6.0 (marshmellow) or newer.
