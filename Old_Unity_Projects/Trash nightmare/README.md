# What's this
The main objective of this assignment was to develop an educational game, and we chose to target the younger generation. Our game is designed to raise awareness about the issues caused by ocean pollution.

Within this project, we created a collection of engaging mini-games that present various challenges related to ocean pollution and showcase the consequences of such.

I once again worked as part of a two-person programming team.
