PLC 4.1: Ran examples from book wth following snipets as examples of results

   fsyacc --module FunPar FunPar.fsy
   fslex --unicode FunLex.fsl
   fsharpi -r ~/fsharp/FsLexYacc.Runtime.dll Absyn.fs FunPar.fs FunLex.fs Parse.fs Fun.fs ParseAndRun.fs

   open ParseAndRun;;
   run (fromString "5+7");; ---result--> val it : int 12

   run (fromString "let y = 7 in y + 2 end");; ---result--> val it : int 9

   run (fromString "let f x = x + 7 in f 2 end");; ---result--> val it : int 9

PLC 4.2
Example program 1:
    run (fromString "let sum n = if n = 1 then n else n + sum (n - 1) in sum 1000 end");;

Example program 2:
    run (fromString "let pow3 n = if n = 0 then 1 else 3 * pow3 (n - 1) in pow3 8 end");;

Example program 3 (spacing added for clarity):
    run (fromString "let pow3 n = if n = 0 then 1 else 3 * pow3 (n - 1) in
                         let f x = if x = 0 then pow3 0 else pow3 x + f(- x-1) in
                             f 11
                         end
                     end");;

Example program 4 (with spacing):
    run (fromString
        "let powTo8 n =
             let powTo m = if m = 0 then 1 else n * powTo (m - 1)
                 in powTo 8
                 end 
         in let sum x = if x = 1 then powTo8 1 else powTo8 x + sum (x - 1)
             in sum 10
             end
         end");;

PLC 4.3
  Look in Absyn.fs and Fun.fs for our solutions. The comment *Exercise 4.3* shows where we have changed something

PLC 4.4
  Look in FunPar.fsy for our solutions, denoted by *Exercise 4.4*

PLC 4.5
  Look in FunLex.fsl and FunPar.fsy for our solutions, again looking for *Exercise 4.5*
