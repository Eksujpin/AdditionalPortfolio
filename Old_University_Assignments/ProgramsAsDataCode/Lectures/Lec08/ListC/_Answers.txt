PLC 10.1

i)
*SP = StackPointer

ADD: 	Takes the two top elements on the stack, adds them together
     	Then saves them in the second to last space and then decremnets the SP

CSTI i: Pushes the next element of program, to the top of the stack, and increse the SP 

NIL: 	pushes a zero on the stack, not tagged as a int, and increse the SP
	The diffrence between this and csti 0 is csti pushes zero tagged as an int 

IFZERO: Checks if the top element of the stack is zero or NIL.
	if true the program counter is set to the adress written after IFZERO
	if false it increses program counter by 1, proceding to the next argument

CONS:	Allocates two spaces on the heap. Then fills the first space with the firste element after CONS
	The second element (after CONS) is then added to the second space. 
	A pointer to the space allocater on the heap is put on the stack.	
	Finally the SP is decresed     

CAR:	Returns the element of the SP

SETCAR: Set the first element of SP to the heap


ii)
Length: Shifts the header to the right, by 2 bits, Removing the color.
	Then applies a bitmask to remove the tag

Color: 	Applies a bitmask to return the last 2 bits aka the color

Paint:	Applies a bitmask to return everything but the last 2 bits aka the color
	Then writing its own color in its place

iii)
The allocate function is called in CONS and No we could not find any other interactions

iv)
If the program looks throug the whole free list and determines that there is not enough space.

changes med in listmachine.c
mark()
markPhase()
sweepPahse()

*this has an error on ex35, we dont know why but we get
33 33 and 12093801234 44
