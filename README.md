# Welcome to my Portfolio!
Here, you will find a collection of my past projects and assignments that showcase my skills and experience in game/software development. This repository is organized into three main folders:

Old_Unity_Projects: This folder contains a selection of Unity projects that I worked on during my high school years. While these projects are outdated, they demonstrate my early experience with game development and highlight my familiarity with C# and game engines such as Unity.

Old_University_Assignments: I've left a few of the assignments that I can upload from university without running into problems with providing solutions to future generations that might be assigned the same tasks.

Recent_Projects: This folder features some of my most recent hobby projects. These projects reflect my ongoing passion for programming and showcase my continuous learning and exploration of new technologies and frameworks. These projects are somewhat few and far between, as I'm not a creative soul who comes up with ideas for what to make but rather a productive person when I have a task or project handed to me.

Feel free to explore the folders and delve into the code of these projects. I hope they provide you with a deeper understanding of my capabilities and development journey.
