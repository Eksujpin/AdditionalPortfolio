# Welcome to my Portfolio!
Here, you will find a collection of my past projects and assignments that showcase my skills and experience in game / software development. This repository is organized into three main folders:

Old_Unity_Projects: This folder contains a selection of Unity projects that I worked on during my high school years. While these projects may be outdated, they demonstrate my early experience with game development and highlight my familiarity with Unity.

Old_University_Assignments: In this folder, you will find a variety of assignments from my university studies. These assignments cover different programming languages and serve as evidence of my proficiency and versatility in various programming paradigms.

Recent_projects: This folder features some of my most recent hobby projects. These projects reflect my ongoing passion for programming and showcase my continuous learning and exploration of new technologies and frameworks. These projects are kinda few and far in between as im not a creative soul that comes up with ideas of what to make, but rather a productive person when i have a task or project handed to me. 

Feel free to explore the folders and delve into the code of these projects. I hope they provide you with a deeper understanding of my capabilities and development journey.
