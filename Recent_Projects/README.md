# What's in here
In this folder, you'll find my most recent projects. Some of these projects may have been stored in private repositories during development, and the finished, incomplete, or unsuccessful versions will be shared here, after removing any potential secrets or storing them safely.

These projects are kinda few and far in between as im not a creative soul that comes up with ideas of what to make, but rather a productive person when i have a task or project handed to me.
Its also worth pointing out that this is not neccecarily the cleanest code im capable of producing as i have a tendency to let private projects get out of hand without thinking of SOLID principals and such as i would do on any kind of production software / software where others than me are invoilved or intended to read them.
